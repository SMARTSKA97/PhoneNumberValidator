## Intention
This project is a basic implementation of Indian Mobile Number Validations based on the number inputs.
This can check dummy/fake numbers based on the number patterns.
This is not 100% perfect. It still can detect some fake/dummy numbers as valid but most are blocked and are following the guidelines of TRAI.

## Future Plans
More stricter implmentation
